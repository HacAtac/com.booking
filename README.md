# service_booking_api
Service Booking API. Useful for business owners that provide services and need a way to dynamically show services, show availability, allows appointment booking, and payments. This is in development, so far as of 04/28/23 I've got services, reviews, user auth, categories completed. And have started on the logic for Booking, Appointments, and Payments. I'm still trying to plan out how I want to handle the flow for them so taking my time. I did however feel the need to implement chat gpt api with this api with admin only auth until i get started with this again 

<ul>
  <li>Services(Complete)</li>
  <li>Reviews(Complete)</li>
  <li>User-Auth(Complete)</li>
  <li>Chat Gpt Admin Endpoint(Complete)</>
  <li>Availability(In Progress)</li>
  <li>Appointment(In Progress)</li>
  <li>Payment(TODO)</li>
  <li>More To Come</li>
</ul>
