# service_booking_api
Service Booking API. Useful for business owners that provide services and need a way to dynamically show services, show availability, allows appointment booking, and payments. This is in development, so far as of 3/1/2022 I've got services, reviews, and user auth completed. Incoming probably later today will be category for filtering services etc. Will be implementing the service availibilty, appointments, and payments in the near future.
